# Snake Game 

## **Introduction 📝**
Snake is a classic arcade game in which the player controls a growing snake that moves around the screen, collecting items (usually represented as dots or food) to increase its length. The game gets progressively harder as the snake grows longer and navigating without colliding becomes more challenging.

## **Getting Started 💻**
1. Go to [snake_game.py](./snake_game.py) and change the file path of images according to the images in the media file.
2. You can change the speed of how fast the snake goes by changing 'SPEED' that can be found at the top of the code.
3. You are also able to change how the snake looks, just download block images of the snake's head or body, download and put it inside the media folder and then replace the file path of the current one in the code.
