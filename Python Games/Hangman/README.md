# HangMan

## **Introduction 📝**
Hangman is a classic word guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player attempts to guess it by suggesting letters, one at a time. Each time the guessed letter is incorrect, a part of a stick figure (the "hangman") is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the entire stick figure is drawn (indicating the player has lost).

## **Getting Started 💻**
1. You can use ['hangman_categories.txt'](./hangman_categories.txt) or create your own list of words in a new text file. (Note that when creating this list, categories should be written in all capital letters like 'VIDEO GAMES' and the words in lower capitals like 'dog'.)
2. replace the file path of the text file with the current text file's path within your directory
3. run [hangman.py](./hangman.py) and enjoy!!
