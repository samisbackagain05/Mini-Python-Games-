# Tetris

## **Introduction üìù**
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where players manipulate falling geometric shapes, known as "tetrominoes," to create horizontal lines without gaps. It was originally designed and developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984 and has become one of the most iconic and widely played games in history.

Key Elements:
Objective: Arrange falling tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines, which are cleared from the playfield. The game continues until the stack of pieces reaches the top of the screen.
Tetrominoes: The shapes are made up of four blocks in various configurations (e.g., I, O, T, S, Z, L, J).
Gameplay Mechanics:
Players can rotate and move the tetrominoes as they fall.
Faster reaction and strategic placement are required as the game progresses.
Scoring: Points are awarded for clearing lines, with more points earned for clearing multiple lines simultaneously.
Increasing Difficulty: The game speeds up as players clear lines, making it progressively harder to place pieces accurately.
Game Over Condition: The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up and exceed the playfield's top boundary.
